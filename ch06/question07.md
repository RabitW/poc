Question:
Given a group of variables, their addresses, and their contents, determine their rvalues, if any, and then determine their lvalues and give the addresses of the locations they specify, if any. Otherwise, note their illegalities. Assume all variables are:

(1) integers (```int```); then
(2) pointers to integers (```int *```),

and that address arithmetic is based on 4-byte integers and pointers.

The table is recreated below:

VAR     |   ADDR    |   CONTENTS    |   VAR     |   ADDR    |   CONTENTS
--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|-----------|-----------
a       |   1040    |   1028        |   o       |   1096    |   1024
c       |   1056    |   1076        |   q       |   1084    |   1072
d       |   1008    |   1016        |   r       |   1068    |   1048
e       |   1032    |   1088        |   s       |   1004    |   2000
f       |   1052    |   1044        |   t       |   1060    |   1012
g       |   1000    |   1064        |   u       |   1036    |   1092
h       |   1080    |   1020        |   v       |   1092    |   1036
i       |   1020    |   1080        |   w       |   1012    |   1060
j       |   1064    |   1000        |   x       |   1072    |   1080
k       |   1044    |   1052        |   y       |   1048    |   1068
m       |   1016    |   1008        |   z       |   2000    |   1000
n       |   1076    |   1056        |           |           |

As a simple example, if variable ```m``` were an integer, its rvalue would be 1008 and its lvalue address at 1016. The incomplete table, save for the first answer, and the expressions is shown first, followed by the answers and any necessary explanations. Finally, a completed table will be shown.

EXPRESSION  | INT RVALUE | INT LVALUE ADDR | INT* RVALUE | INT* LVALUE ADDR
------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------------
(a) ```m```       |   1008     |   1016          |   1008      |   1016
(b) ```v + 1```   |    |  |   |
(c) ```j - 4```   |
(d) ```a - d```   |
(e) ```v - w```   |
(f) ```&c```      |
(g) ```&e + 1```  |
(h) ```&o - 4```  |
(i) ```&(f + 2)```|
(j) ```*g```      |
(k) ```*k + 1```  |
(l) ```*(n + 1)```|
(m) ```*h - 4```  |
(n) ```*(u + 4)```|
(o) ```*f - g```  |
(p) ```*f - *g``` |
(q) ```*s - *q``` |
(r) ```*(r - t)```|
(s) ```y > i ```  |
(t) ```y > *i ``` |
(u) ```*y > *i``` |
(v) ```**h   ```  |
(w) ```c++```     |
(x) ```++c  ```   |
(y)``` *q++```    |
(z) ```(*q)++``` |
(aa)  ```*++q```|
(bb)```++*q```|
(cc) ```*++*q```|
(dd)```++*(*q)++```|

First, let's use simple definitions of lvalue and rvalue from [Eli Bendersky] (http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/12/15/understanding-lvalues-and-rvalues-in-c-and-c). It would be advised to discuss what lvalues and rvalues are before answering the question. An lvalue: "represents an object that occupies some identifiable location in memory (i.e. has an address)". An rvalue "is an expression that does not represent an object occupying some **identifiable** location in memory" [emphasis mine]. To continue his example:

```c
4 = var;        // ERROR!
(var + 1) = 4;  // ERROR!
```

The above expressions are not legal lvalues because "both are temporary results of expressions, which don't have an identifiable memory location (i.e. they can just reside in some temporary register for the duration of the computation). Therefore, assigning to them makes no semantic sense - there's nowhere to assign to."

In addition to the above, for programming newbs like myself, it is easier to remember that an expression can be a legal lvalue or represent a legal lvalue address if it can be assigned to (that is, can it exist on the left-hand side of an assignment operator?). Consider an rvalue to be a legal evaluation of an expression.
